Park Management System
This repository contains the source code for a simple Park Management System written in C. The program allows users to park different types of vehicles, including buses, cars, bikes, and autos, and keeps track of the earnings and the number of each type of vehicle parked.

Features

Receipt Generation: After successfully parking a vehicle, the system generates a receipt with details such as the customer's name, vehicle number, date, and the parking fee paid.

Availability Check: Users can check if their vehicle is currently parked in the system by providing their name, vehicle number, and the date.

Insight Display: The system provides insights into the total earnings and the number of each type of vehicle parked.
